# Hello-world
my first repository

Hola mundo!

I'm JS, sadly I haven't had tacos on the moon yet, but the ones down here are pretty good.
My programming journey is only beginning, so far I've dabbed with HTML, CSS and I'm starting to dive into Javascript.
What I know I've learned by myself till this point, but I'm looking for guidance on this trip to becoming a world changer.
